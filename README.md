# BASH SCRIPTS

Hi everyone!

I'll treat this repository as an open archive to post from time to time my personal bash
scripts which I use to ease my `GNU/Linux` experience. By the way, given that I am only
at the very beginning of this Linux journey, do not expect some convoluted magic to happen
here; nevertheless, who knows.

**I do not care** if any of you finds that there are tasks accomplished by my scripts that are
already satisfied by the use of another software, since if I wrote a script it would have been
*because I could not find a tool to do what I wanted/needed to at the moment I wrote it, or else
just for having fun doing something productive and/or useful as an exercise*.

No doubts you are welcome to point out flaws or improvement opportunities.

You are obviously free to use any of this, yet if by any weird chance you do so,
**I would kindly ask to refer to this repo**.

Thanks :)
